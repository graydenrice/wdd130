    <h2>Grayden Rice</h2>
    <p>Hello my name name is Grayde Rice. I am not married and I live in the Clearfield, Utah area.
    I am going for my BS in Applied Technology because I like technology and I think it is a very
    useful skill to know.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints since 8</p>
    <p>I currently work as a grounds keeper at a local technical college. All of my hobbies have to do with making things. 
    One of my favorites is making rings.</p>
    <p>I am hopeing to start a business and this course will be a great help in getting a website set-up for that.
    </p>
