            Opal: I many of the rings we make you will notice that we use opal. 
            The opal in our rings is not natural but is actually lab grown. 
            Even though our opal is not natural it still had the same beauty 
            as a natural opal does. You will be able to see the same shimmer 
            in lab grown opal as you will natural opal. The lab grown opal is 
            less expensive and stronger making it so your rings will last much 
            longer.
