      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I would like to create a website for my business of making rings. I would like it to be a 
        place where I can advertise my rings and other pieces of my art. What makes my business 
        different than others is the rings I make are unique and made with special materials like opal and gold. 
        Each ring is very customizable to each person. Wouldnt you like a unique and one-of-a-kind ring? 
        One that stands out from all the rest?  That is the purpose of my business, 
        to bring exciting new styles of rings to people.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p> My target audience are people between the ages of 20 and 80 with more of a focus on 
        people between the ages of 20 and 40. The people I am most likely to have wanting to 
        purchase a ring as a gift are those in the 20-40 and in the 40 and above it is more for 
        people who are wanting a new wedding band. The price of the rings is relatively low at 
        between 75 and 100 USD, allowing me to sell to people in most financial situations unlike 
        most other ring places with their very high prices.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        Advertise Business: The first purpose of my website is to advertise my business. People 
        will come to my website to see the many different rings that I create. This will be a 
        great way for me to display my rings for more people to be able to see. People will be 
        able to discover all of my unique designs that are hand made by me. I will be able to 
        peak people interest from the first page to purchase a ring. The ability to customize 
        their own ring will be a real selling point from the advertisement page of my website. 
        I can use a lot of the different materials that I use in each ring to make people interested 
        in purchasing one of my rings for themselves. I can also put an FAQ on my site so people 
        can ask questions and I can discover more of what people are looking for so that I can 
        adjust my business in whatever ways are needed. There are also a lot of questions people 
        have with jewelry and the materials I would need to answer.</p>       
      <p> 
        Advertise Business: This page will include a quick link to the shop page so people can 
        easily access the next page. There will be a small product gallery made of three different 
        products. The products will be best sellers, new products, or products that are out for 
        only a limited amount of time. A brief description will also be provided on this page to 
        give people and good idea of what it is exactly this business is. Also on this page will 
        be an FAQ which will be available for people to be able to ask questions pertaining to 
        shipping and fulfillment and more information on the products. Also included on this page 
        will be links to social media pages and a quick reference to contact information will be 
        provided.

        <img src="images/flower.jpg" alt="image for homepage">



      </ul>
      <h3>Shop</h3>
      <p>
        Sell Rings: The second purpose of my site is for me to be able to sell my rings. When 
        people come to my site, they should be able to find what the prices of my rings are. 
        They should be able to select their size of ring and the style they want for their ring. 
        There will also be a place for people to go to be able to customize a ring for themselves, 
        they will be able to choose their own materials for the rings to make it more personal to 
        them. The ability to make the ring your own is a very important part of my business. With 
        the unique styles I offer already, having people be able to create their own designs give 
        more uniqueness to my business. The customization makes my site a reason for people to come 
        to my site rather than going to another site of the same thing. With the customization if 
        the rings from my site, I will have a place where people can ask about/request different 
        materials that I dont have listed on my site so that I can add more things that people like 
        to my list of materials and be able to expand the number of costumers that my site receives 
        and increasing my overall business.</p>
      <p>  
        Shop: the shop page will include a product gallery for the rest of the products. Under each 
        of the products will include the product name, the price, and whether or not the product is 
        still available. The header and footer will of course remain the same as it is on the home page.

      </ul>
      <h3>Blog</h3>
      <p>
        Blog/Information: Because I hand make each ring and create each of the designs for each ring 
        I make. This is a big reason my site will be one that people will want to go too, the uniqueness 
        of what I make is the reason my website can get a lot of traffic. A blog is a good way to have 
        a more personal connection with my audience. Having a place where I can show the process of making 
        each ring and have other information there for people will help me be able to answer questions they 
        might have. This could also be helpful as a place to talk about the different materials used and 
        what I am coming up with next. This is also a place where I could help other that are interested 
        in making rings themselves to be able to get tips and trick to be able to try making rings for 
        themselves. I can also post videos of me making the rings to spark the interest of people to want 
        to buy/make rings. I can make more personal posts on the blog to make people more interested in my 
        business and what I do.</p>
      <p>
        Blog: The blog page will be a place where I can post news and updates about products and other 
        information or changes that I make. Other information will also be posted about materials used, 
        ring sizing, and shipping information.  The header and the footer will remain the same as on other 
        pages.
